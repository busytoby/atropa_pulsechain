[19:52:55] <mariarahel> i can highly recommend achieving holdings of tokens proportional to the same holdings of the 414 address
[19:53:38] <mariarahel> even sukuk
[19:54:02] <mariarahel> if you want a bunch of LOAN and have a good reason i might just give it to you
[19:54:10] <mariarahel> or FREEBIES

[19:54:56] <ogwebchef888> Sweet
[19:55:04] <ogwebchef888> I'd pump ZOC with it
[19:55:15] <ogwebchef888> It's already connected.
[19:55:32] <coffee_> What about Papa DB Cooper Smurf?
[19:55:37] <mariarahel> i would considering giving equal large proportion to bot runners one LOAN & the other FREEBIES
[19:55:39] <coffee_> How does he become one with the universe
[19:55:53] <mariarahel> Cooper ?
[19:56:11] <ogwebchef888> Volume boosting bot ? I can make that happen
[19:56:21] Nick change: as-cal-tjader -> big-float-tank
[19:56:25] <coffee_> yes 
[19:56:50] <mariarahel> gotta make sure it's a good plan first
[19:56:56] <ogwebchef888> I think surf has a cool wash bot too
[19:57:03] <ogwebchef888> Yeah for sure
[19:57:25] <coffee_> Disneys confused
[19:57:27] <ead11> I recall for nba yes
[19:57:59] <ogwebchef888> We can make it help keep treasury bill trending along with Atropa/Teddy
[19:57:59] <ead11> Disney will replenish one day and Bhutan will be at peace
[19:58:02] <ogwebchef888> For max exposure
[19:58:26] <ogwebchef888> Open to thoughts but def you got a whole army counting the bots we would run for you
[20:03:55] <mariarahel> it should be something observers can pick up and get in on
[20:05:55] <mariarahel> if it can be arranged such that the 414 address can't wreck it even while holding a massive amount more of tokens then i'm completely sold
[20:06:19] <mariarahel> i'm not sure if that's possible
[20:06:30] <ogwebchef888> hmm

[20:09:54] <ogwebchef888> I'm on a mission to create hyper deflation with Finvesta and happy to pair some with it to help the cause along with using it for boosting volume with bots.
[20:10:07] <ogwebchef888> Can create some exit liquidity that way
[20:10:15] <ogwebchef888> while burning tokens
[20:10:31] <mariarahel> i think there was $8k on liquidity between LOAN&FREEBIES last time i looked
[20:11:15] <ogwebchef888> Hegemony looks good. Maybe pair some LOAN with it ?
[20:11:29] <mariarahel> not until it's operational
[20:11:39] <ogwebchef888> Ok

[20:16:49] <candlekindle> I believe that SunnyDay could use and understands how to properly deploy some LOAN and/or FREEBIES for A1A or possibly a different project. But I'll leave that up to him should he choose to further the topic.

[20:25:23] <mariarahel> i considered airdropping freebies regularly for some specific types of on-chain actions small wallets incur could be beneficial
[20:25:49] <SunnyDay> There is always a way. Massacre and Loan are both good LP plays. Could make something with a mass/loan front door, that gives the holders LP thru arbitrage.  
[20:26:32] <mariarahel> i think the freebies should be easily convertible into more interesting tokens
[20:26:38] <mariarahel> not held on to

[20:31:35] <mariarahel> imagine since gas fees are low some wallet with say $25-50 makes like 10 transactions
[20:31:51] <mariarahel> they should be dropped like $15 worth of freebies

[20:46:25] <ogwebchef888> LFG
[20:46:28] <mariarahel> exactly 4 months since all time high peaked at 3c
[20:47:02] <mariarahel> then Zurich launch crashed it
[20:51:01] <Vlad> did Zurich take a bunch of the liquidity/volume away or something else?
[20:51:32] <mariarahel> it was launched such to give preference to earlier buyers of several obscure tokens and the robots destroyed it
[20:52:02] <mariarahel> that irc channel was opened right after
[20:52:16] <mariarahel> this rather
[20:52:19] <mariarahel> the
[20:52:27] <mariarahel> #pulsechain really
[20:52:53] <mariarahel> 200:1 on some of them
[20:54:37] <Vlad> so if you held Zurich how would it give preferences to earlier buyers for those tokens?
[20:55:02] <mariarahel> holders of the early tokens got first buy on zurich at very preferential level
[20:55:08] <mariarahel> if they were auto-trading
[20:55:51] <mariarahel> there was mass selling out into stables
[20:56:00] <mariarahel> then the stables crashed
[20:57:32] <Vlad> gotcha I really need to finish up my dex bot been building out all the basic functionality and want to use ai to help me find some preferable trades do you have any recommendations on the best and beneficial kind of defi bot? I've heard of MEV bots but I am not sure I am as happy making money off other peoples loss is there any strategies that you think are better than others? 
[20:58:39] <mariarahel> i don't do any bot stuff yet
[20:58:59] <mariarahel> might not ever
[20:59:09] <Vlad> really do you not even have a few scripts to sell/buy out of a bigger position? 
[20:59:16] <mariarahel> zero
[20:59:26] <mariarahel> 100% point & click
[20:59:58] <Vlad> haha no way so you have deployed all those tokens and orchestrated this master piece with no bots? How can the transaction count be so high then?
[21:00:01] <mariarahel> i have some api routines for the scan rpc finished but that's it
[21:00:15] <ShakeelAhmed> looking at the nonukes leaderboard; bff is gaining fast on NBA.  
[21:00:31] <mariarahel> ya, if you look at nonukes all the bots are traffic on those

[21:03:44] <Vlad> so I built this app https://impactai.ca/home and it's an AI user chat platform and I wanted to use this api to scan for top traders and then check the mempool if one of those top traders have a pending transaction would that be a good idea or any of your wisdom would be greatly appreciated haha
