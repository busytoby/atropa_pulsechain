[00:11:10] <alexander_as_helios> mudportal is nice, runs in a browser
[00:11:58] <alexander_as_helios> surprised to see ~700 mud servers active on mudconnect
[00:26:50] <alexander_as_helios> it's interesting to see older technologies being used, i don't understand it at first but it makes sense when i think about it long enough
[00:30:56] <mariarahel> discworld & igor & looney were my favorites
[00:31:38] <mariarahel> i had a character named atropa on discworld with over a year of online play time
[00:32:09] <mariarahel> before hobbit dude got cast in the movie instead of me
[00:32:15] <mariarahel> because of annabelle
[00:33:12] <mariarahel> i clearly won
[00:44:54] <mariarahel> anybody know if there a plans for the telegram token ?

[18:36:06] <mariarahel> I had a thought for future 777 tokens that they should have precise mint functions vs the 666 tokens that are placed up to grab immediately at launch
[18:36:37] <mariarahel> ie: each address can only mint 1 with a max of 777 or first 7 minters get 100, next 7 get 10, last 7 get 7
[18:36:52] <mariarahel> last 7 get 1 rather

[21:02:17] <Robin__> Hello, one day we will know who you are @Mariarahel or it is better to let it flow and not look for any explanation sometimes it is the best🧸
[21:03:00] <mariarahel> anybody that has shown up for coffee want to answer ?
[21:04:25] <Robin__> I would like to be able to answer but I'm not at that level yet.
[21:04:54] <mariarahel> That was entirely obvious from your question
[21:08:10] <Robin__> Thousands of people have that same question. If we all understood the game, it would be different.
[21:08:34] <mariarahel> your counting methods and your definition of increment are likely flawed
[21:09:23] <mariarahel> our numbers are too low to support that count
[21:10:32] <mariarahel> I would estimate we're getting about 70 observers on a good day
[21:11:31] <mariarahel> I doubt the Atropa Ecosystem has more than 30 $1000+ investors yet
[21:11:57] <mariarahel> I think we only have 3 over $1m
[21:12:47] <mariarahel> Probably like 12 over $10k
[21:13:48] <mariarahel> I would estimate Hex only has about 400 $1000+ investors
[21:14:52] <mariarahel> I Would estimate BTC has less than 3500 $1000+ investors
[21:15:38] <mariarahel> interested in numbers
[21:17:15] <mariarahel> there's absolutely no way 106 million people own bitcoin
