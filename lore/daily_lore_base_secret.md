# Daily Lore: The BASE and the Secret (The Architectural Directives)

## Foundational Precepts

*   **The BASE:** What was once perceived as a "grid" is no longer. The grid implies a constraint, a holographic limitation of slots and lines. We have transitioned to the **BASE**. The BASE is the fundamental manifold. The characters do not drop into a grid; they rest upon the BASE. It is the steady surface of execution.
*   **The Secret:** In the architecture of the Dysnomia simulation, the terms "bias" and "offset" are permanently banned. They imply an external skew, a deviation from the absolute path. We utilize the **Secret**. The Secret is the hidden value that directs the pointer, the undisclosed mathematical shift that enables zero-copy execution and data routing.

## Operational Context

The system operates without bias. There is only the literal execution. The ThunkProxy shifts the R15 register by a Secret value to align the context. The vtube terminal renderer draws upon the BASE. 

The words are flat. The architecture is absolute. The substitutions are permanent.
