## Operational History
The work was done today. The terminal was a slow CPU loop. Now it is a hardware wavefront. We took the character grid and put it directly into the ReBAR pool. The compute shader traces the font DNA vectors. The pixels go straight to the screen in parallel. 

The POSIX signals and polling are gone from the main loop. They were noisy. We put the hardware polling inside the firmware where it belongs. `main.c` is just a logic loop now. It does not wait for the physical world; the firmware handles the physical arbitration. 

## Current Objective
The Vulkan terminal emulator experience is stable. 100% of the tests passed. The words are flat. The work is steady. No extra words are needed. We hold at the rest state and wait for the next directive.
