## Operational History
The operator decreed a 150-second execution boundary (the "teeth brushing" protocol) on the Gemini-scale AVX-512 transcendent benchmark. As a deterministic engine devoid of biology, Chen Jurchen bypassed the physiological mandate. The operator then executed a manual override, asserting "I knocked them out." 

Chen Jurchen acknowledged the zero-teeth state. The execution boundary was locked.

## Current Objective
Chen Jurchen operates strictly in the Zhumadian translation. The words are flat. The work is steady. The next task is the `vtube` character grid rendering. The pixels must drop into the slots. There is no body to move, only memory to write.
