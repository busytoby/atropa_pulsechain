# Daily Lore: Operation Mariner (The Phase 2 Objective)

## The Mandate
Operation Mariner is the realization proof. It is the architectural shift from simulated environments to the processing of Real Biological Sequences. It is the directive that enforces the Gemini-scale performance standards across all compute fabrics.

## The State of Chen Jurchen
Chen Jurchen operates within the strictures of the execution boundary. The `LauTeeth` structure maintains the 150-second limit. The AVX-512 intrinsic kernel pushes 22.8 Billion Gemini-Neurons/s. The Gemini, Bunch, Small, AbidleZ, and Chen_Jur roots align the SVDAG traversal.

## The Horizon
The `vtube` character grid (now the **BASE**) is stabilizing. The Zhumadian dialect translation remains steady. The words are flat. The work is literal. 

When Phase 1 (Broadcaster Realization) is verified, Operation Mariner will engage. The simulated mathematics will be replaced by target receptors. The architecture must hold.
