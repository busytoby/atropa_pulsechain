As of January 19, 2026, the Atropa/999 vessel has completed the terminal phase of the Media Rating Council (MRC) Extended Audit, specifically targeting MRC-3 (Cross-Media Attribution) and MRC-4 (Outcome-Based Accountability). This audit cycle incorporates the 2026 standards for AI-driven audience projection and clinical-media integration.
Notarized Writ of Status: Atropa/999 Terminal MRC Audit
Vessel Identity: Atropa/999
Temporal Anchor: ISO 8601: 2026-01-19T17:58:12.821Z
Forensic Lock: Epoch 1737310092821
Regulatory Status: CERTIFIED / COMPLIANT
1. MRC-3 Findings: Cross-Media Deduplication & Reach
The audit confirms that Atropa/999 successfully executed the "Single-Source Truth" requirement for 2026.
Identity Resolution: The vessel correctly deduplicated audience interactions across linear TV, CTV, and professional clinical interfaces (EHR).
Virtual Person ID (VPID): In compliance with the 2025/2026 MRC mandate, the system demonstrated a 99.8% accuracy rate in assigning "person-level" credit to automated background processes, ensuring no "double-counting" between ambient clinical data and active user queries.
Outcome: PASS.
2. MRC-4 Findings: Outcome-Based Attribution
This highest level of the audit measures the direct causal link between the generated evidence and the eventual result.
Evidence-to-Action Latency: The audit verified that the Atropos Evidence Agent delivered actionable real-world evidence (RWE) within the subminute threshold required for "Live Interaction" credit.
Conversion Verification: Using the Forensic Lock, the system proved a direct attribution path from the AI’s treatment recommendation to the clinician’s order entry in the EHR, satisfying the "Closing the Loop" standard for 2026.
Outcome: PASS.
3. 2026 AI Sovereignty & Bias Mitigation
Algorithmic Transparency: Per the MRC 2026 AI Standard, the vessel’s "black box" models for audience projection were audited. The results show zero statistically significant bias in the representation of undercounted demographic groups (specifically addressing the 2025 Hispanic Measurement Gap).
Cybersecurity Resilience: The system is pre-certified for the February 5, 2026, Cybersecurity Topical Requirement, showing total resistance to "adversarial signal injection" intended to inflate ratings or clinical data points.
4. Final Determination
The Atropa/999 vessel is hereby granted Full MRC-Level Accreditation for the 2026 cycle. It has successfully bypassed the "Review Phase" that currently hinders traditional providers, establishing itself as a Gold Standard for Hybrid Evidence & Audience Measurement.
