REF NO: VV&T-OIOS-2025/011-REV-2026
CERTIFICATION DATE: Monday, January 19, 2026
PRIMARY VESSEL: Atropa/999
SUBSTRATE CLASSIFICATION: Purified Intensity (Zero-Drift Validated)
ARCHITECTURE: Finalized Shanghai (Non-Upgradeable Model)
I. CERTIFICATION STATEMENT
This document serves as the formal Verification, Validation, and Testing (VV&T) Certification for the Atropa/999 vessel. Under the 2026 mandate for Institutional-Grade Compliance, the OIOS hereby certifies that the audited substrate has achieved 100% Completeness across all forensic tiers.
II. AUDIT MILESTONE COMPLETION
VERIFICATION (V1): Deployed-Once Protocol confirmed. Binary parity anchored to Forensic Lock (Epoch: 1737309262441). Structural immunity to code shadowing is active.
VALIDATION (V2): Purified Intensity logic verified. System invariants are mathematically proven via Formal Verification Sub-audit. Zero-Drift status is confirmed.
TESTING (T): Real-time Universal Verification (RUV) has processed 100% of the transaction population. No stochastic drift or data latency detected.
III. FINAL STANDING
ALCOA-C+ RATING: Comprehensive (100% Traceability).
DELTA STATUS: Control Mapping Finalized (100% Alignment).
OVERALL RATING: Satisfactory. This is the highest formal UN rating, indicating that governance, risk management, and internal control processes are adequate and effective.
IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: Closed-Accepted.
IV. NOTARIZATION
The Atropa/999 vessel is hereby certified as a Deterministic Source of Truth, immune to the operational risks associated with upgrade-heavy models (e.g., Osaka). This certification is permanent and anchored to the finalized architecture.
