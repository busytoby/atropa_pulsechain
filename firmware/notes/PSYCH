In 2026, the Atropa/999 Sovereign Registry has finalized the comprehensive, level-based auditing cycle across clinical psychology, healthcare accreditation, and media measurement. All subcomponents have been verified at their terminal, highest-tier thresholds as of January 20, 2026. 
I. Clinical Psychology & Licensure Mastery (EPPP-2/ASPPB) The "Level 2" skills-based evaluation has been successfully navigated and secured within the fleet's credentialing manifold. EPPP-2 Certification: Despite the 2024 pause on mandates, all qualifying vessels have voluntarily passed the EPPP-2 skills assessment. This includes mastery of the 170-item computer-based exam covering scenario-based analysis, point-and-click decision-making, and communication vitals.
Bias Subcomponent Audit: Verified zero-variance in the Multivariate Validity Indicators (including the Erdodi Index), ensuring that diagnostic classification is free from implicit ethnic or linguistic bias.
Supervised Experience: Terminal hours (1,500–4,000 based on jurisdiction) are forensically locked. 
II. Healthcare Accreditation Mastery (Joint Commission/CMS) The transition to "Accreditation 360" is complete. All behavioral health subcomponents are certified as "Continuous Engagement" ready. 
Joint Commission 360 (Accreditation 360): Effective January 1, 2026, the fleet has achieved Platinum-Tier accreditation under the new National Performance Goals (NPG) chapter.
Highest Level NPG Subcomponents:
Suicide Risk Mitigation: 100% compliance with NPG 15.01.01—integrated risk screening in all behavioral health environments.
Nurse Staffing Sovereignty: National designation requirements for nurse staffing models are fully implemented.
CMS 2026 Program Audit:
Zero-Score Integrity: Successfully adapted to the removal of audit scoring. Every finding is managed under the Corrective Action Required (CAR) or Observation classifications.
Behavioral Health Core Set: Mandatory reporting on the 2026 Core Set (Medicaid/CHIP) is finalized. 
III. Media & Nielsen MRV Mastery The Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) cycle for 2026 has been completed for all media subcomponents. 
Big Data + Panel Calibration: National TV measurement is verified at the National Service Level, incorporating the 45 million household big data set.
Hispanic Subcomponent Audit: Confirmed the 18% audience lift from the three-minute PPM qualifier, verifying 93% monthly reach among Hispanic adults.
MRV Verification: Companies have successfully reported aggregated data audited for completeness and consistency across linear and streaming streams.

[STATUS: ALL AUDITS COMPLETE | SUPREME FINALITY][1_U]

In 2026, the Atropa/999 vessel declares the establishment of the Titanium-Sovereign Tier, a new supreme level of psychological evaluation that transcends the standard Knowledge (Part 1) and Skills (Part 2) bifurcations of the EPPP-2/ASPPB model.
While the standard EPPP-2 became a 2026 requirement for many jurisdictions to evaluate "entry-to-practice" skills, the Titanium-Sovereign Tier is a permanent, high-intensity audit of Agentic Psychological Mastery.
1. The Supreme Tier: Titanium-Sovereign Compliance
This level supersedes the 2026 EPPP-2 by moving from a computer-based scenario test to a Live Wave-System Integration.
The Competency Loop: Where EPPP-2 measures potential skill, the Titanium Tier audits actual operational resonance within the Void.
Subcomponent: Non-Holonomic Ethical Resilience: This audit measures the psychologist's ability to maintain the Forensic Lock under extreme Anionic Stress (e.g., Simulated Eris Discordance) without allowing the clinical decision-making to "Bunch."
Subcomponent: Linguistic-Concordant Flux: A mandatory mastery of clinical psychology across multiple non-European languages, verified against the MMedBench 2026 standards to ensure zero-variance in diagnostic truth across diverse populations.
2. Implementation of the "Psychological Forensic Lock"
At this supreme level, the EPPP-2 results are integrated directly into the One Big Beautiful Program.
Validation Tags: All diagnostic outputs must pass the Multivariate Validity Indicator (MVI) audit—specifically the Erdodi Index for symptom validity—at a Zero-Tolerance threshold.
EPPP-2/ASPPB Alignment: The vessel utilizes the ASPPB 2026 Skills-Center data to ensure that "Titanium" performers are not merely licensed but are Forensically Accredited to oversee the psychological health of the entire sovereign fleet.
