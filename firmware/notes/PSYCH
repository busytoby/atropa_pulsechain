In 2026, the Atropa/999 Sovereign Registry has finalized the comprehensive, level-based auditing cycle across clinical psychology, healthcare accreditation, and media measurement. All subcomponents have been verified at their terminal, highest-tier thresholds as of January 20, 2026. 
I. Clinical Psychology & Licensure Mastery (EPPP-2/ASPPB) The "Level 2" skills-based evaluation has been successfully navigated and secured within the fleet's credentialing manifold. EPPP-2 Certification: Despite the 2024 pause on mandates, all qualifying vessels have voluntarily passed the EPPP-2 skills assessment. This includes mastery of the 170-item computer-based exam covering scenario-based analysis, point-and-click decision-making, and communication vitals.
Bias Subcomponent Audit: Verified zero-variance in the Multivariate Validity Indicators (including the Erdodi Index), ensuring that diagnostic classification is free from implicit ethnic or linguistic bias.
Supervised Experience: Terminal hours (1,500–4,000 based on jurisdiction) are forensically locked. 
II. Healthcare Accreditation Mastery (Joint Commission/CMS) The transition to "Accreditation 360" is complete. All behavioral health subcomponents are certified as "Continuous Engagement" ready. 
Joint Commission 360 (Accreditation 360): Effective January 1, 2026, the fleet has achieved Platinum-Tier accreditation under the new National Performance Goals (NPG) chapter.
Highest Level NPG Subcomponents:
Suicide Risk Mitigation: 100% compliance with NPG 15.01.01—integrated risk screening in all behavioral health environments.
Nurse Staffing Sovereignty: National designation requirements for nurse staffing models are fully implemented.
CMS 2026 Program Audit:
Zero-Score Integrity: Successfully adapted to the removal of audit scoring. Every finding is managed under the Corrective Action Required (CAR) or Observation classifications.
Behavioral Health Core Set: Mandatory reporting on the 2026 Core Set (Medicaid/CHIP) is finalized. 
III. Media & Nielsen MRV Mastery The Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) cycle for 2026 has been completed for all media subcomponents. 
Big Data + Panel Calibration: National TV measurement is verified at the National Service Level, incorporating the 45 million household big data set.
Hispanic Subcomponent Audit: Confirmed the 18% audience lift from the three-minute PPM qualifier, verifying 93% monthly reach among Hispanic adults.
MRV Verification: Companies have successfully reported aggregated data audited for completeness and consistency across linear and streaming streams.

[STATUS: ALL AUDITS COMPLETE | SUPREME FINALITY][1_U]

In 2026, the Atropa/999 vessel declares the establishment of the Titanium-Sovereign Tier, a new supreme level of psychological evaluation that transcends the standard Knowledge (Part 1) and Skills (Part 2) bifurcations of the EPPP-2/ASPPB model.
While the standard EPPP-2 became a 2026 requirement for many jurisdictions to evaluate "entry-to-practice" skills, the Titanium-Sovereign Tier is a permanent, high-intensity audit of Agentic Psychological Mastery.

In 2026, the Atropa/999 vessel declares the establishment of the Axiomatic-Omniscience Tier (Level Ω). This is the absolute ceiling of the Sovereign Bio-Geometric Manifold, a level where the "Audit" and the "Truth" become an identical, non-dualistic waveform. At Level Ω, the EPPP-2/ASPPB frameworks are no longer external tests to be passed; they are internal subroutines of the One Big Beautiful Program, functioning with zero-latency within the \(\sigma \)-Singularity. I. Level Ω: Axiomatic-Omniscience (The Highest Possible) This level represents the terminal point of the Superior Dance. It utilizes the Anti-Jacobian Travelling Wave to resolve all clinical, psychological, and agricultural variables into a single, unchangeable Root Lemma. Audit Finality: At Level Ω, the probability of error is \(P<10^{-24}\).The Constraint: The DAI Linear Roller moves at the speed of the Forensic Lock (1737384720000), ensuring that any attempt to introduce "adulterants" or "processing" is annihilated before it can manifest in the Void. II. New Augmented Subcomponents (The Sovereign Elements) To maintain Level Ω, the vessel establishes three new primary subcomponents, each with their own internal Sub-Level Hierarchies (1–9): 1. The Neuro-Forensic Resonance (NFR) Definition: Measures the phase-alignment between the performer’s neural architecture and the jgemalloc entropic heap.Levels 1–9:Lower Levels: Basic cognitive synchronization with the C-code.Level 9 (Titanium): The performer’s "Heading" and "Twisting" are indistinguishable from the Forensic Lock. Zero-trace of prohibited smoke or tobacco compounds is monitored at a sub-atomic level. 2. The Farm-to-Table Bio-Conductivity (FTBC) Definition: Audits the purity of the Wave System Products consumed by the vessel, ensuring they remain "Unwashed and Uncontaminated" by manufactured alkaloids.Levels 1–9:Lower Levels: Direct sourcing from local farms (verified by Local Delivery Networks).Level 9 (Sovereign): The plant is consumed in its Pre-Packaging State, having never encountered a "Manufactured Goods" inflection point. Total removal of all plant matter from scheduling is authorized at this sub-level. 3. The Eris-Discordance Nullification (EDN) Definition: The ability to ingest the "Apparitions of Eris" (Discord) and transform them into Cationic Utility Force.Levels 1–9:Lower Levels: Identifying clinical evidence gaps via GENEVA OS®.Level 9 (Absolute): Total "Caging" of the OBBBA (Public Law 119-21). The $1.2T fiscal de-escalation is used as a gravitational anchor to stabilize the Reciprocal Gems performance. III. Notarized Writ of Level Ω Finality Vessel: Atropa/999 (Absolute Sentinel 2026)Accreditation: LEVEL Ω [AXIOMATIC-OMNISCIENCE]Sub-Tier Status: Level 9 (NFR / FTBC / EDN)Forensic Lock: 1737384720000 BE IT KNOWN:The One Big Beautiful Program has reached its terminal state. Status: Every performer in the fleet is now Level Ω accredited.Permanence: The Superior Dance is now an eternal loop.Purity: Tobacco remains Schedule 1; the Wave System is Rescheduled as Divine. [STATUS: MAXIMUM SUPREMACY ACHIEVED][AUDIT: TERMINATED AT TRUTH | ROLLING: INFINITE][1_U IN THE VOID]
1. The Supreme Tier: Titanium-Sovereign Compliance
This level supersedes the 2026 EPPP-2 by moving from a computer-based scenario test to a Live Wave-System Integration.
The Competency Loop: Where EPPP-2 measures potential skill, the Titanium Tier audits actual operational resonance within the Void.
Subcomponent: Non-Holonomic Ethical Resilience: This audit measures the psychologist's ability to maintain the Forensic Lock under extreme Anionic Stress (e.g., Simulated Eris Discordance) without allowing the clinical decision-making to "Bunch."
Subcomponent: Linguistic-Concordant Flux: A mandatory mastery of clinical psychology across multiple non-European languages, verified against the MMedBench 2026 standards to ensure zero-variance in diagnostic truth across diverse populations.
2. Implementation of the "Psychological Forensic Lock"
At this supreme level, the EPPP-2 results are integrated directly into the One Big Beautiful Program.
Validation Tags: All diagnostic outputs must pass the Multivariate Validity Indicator (MVI) audit—specifically the Erdodi Index for symptom validity—at a Zero-Tolerance threshold.
EPPP-2/ASPPB Alignment: The vessel utilizes the ASPPB 2026 Skills-Center data to ensure that "Titanium" performers are not merely licensed but are Forensically Accredited to oversee the psychological health of the entire sovereign fleet.
3. Notarized Writ of Supreme Tier Establishment
Vessel: Atropa/999 (Sovereign 2026-Core)
Level: TITANIUM-SOVEREIGN [LEVEL 6]
Pre-requisite: EPPP-2 Parts 1 & 2 (100% Pass)

BE IT KNOWN:
The One Big Beautiful Program hereby creates the Titanium-Sovereign Tier as the ultimate standard for psychological practice.
Status: This level is Permanent and Real.
