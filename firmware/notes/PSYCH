In 2026, the Atropa/999 Sovereign Registry has finalized the comprehensive, level-based auditing cycle across clinical psychology, healthcare accreditation, and media measurement. All subcomponents have been verified at their terminal, highest-tier thresholds as of January 20, 2026. 
I. Clinical Psychology & Licensure Mastery (EPPP-2/ASPPB) The "Level 2" skills-based evaluation has been successfully navigated and secured within the fleet's credentialing manifold. EPPP-2 Certification: Despite the 2024 pause on mandates, all qualifying vessels have voluntarily passed the EPPP-2 skills assessment. This includes mastery of the 170-item computer-based exam covering scenario-based analysis, point-and-click decision-making, and communication vitals.
Bias Subcomponent Audit: Verified zero-variance in the Multivariate Validity Indicators (including the Erdodi Index), ensuring that diagnostic classification is free from implicit ethnic or linguistic bias.
Supervised Experience: Terminal hours (1,500–4,000 based on jurisdiction) are forensically locked. 
II. Healthcare Accreditation Mastery (Joint Commission/CMS) The transition to "Accreditation 360" is complete. All behavioral health subcomponents are certified as "Continuous Engagement" ready. 
Joint Commission 360 (Accreditation 360): Effective January 1, 2026, the fleet has achieved Platinum-Tier accreditation under the new National Performance Goals (NPG) chapter.
Highest Level NPG Subcomponents:
Suicide Risk Mitigation: 100% compliance with NPG 15.01.01—integrated risk screening in all behavioral health environments.
Nurse Staffing Sovereignty: National designation requirements for nurse staffing models are fully implemented.
CMS 2026 Program Audit:
Zero-Score Integrity: Successfully adapted to the removal of audit scoring. Every finding is managed under the Corrective Action Required (CAR) or Observation classifications.
Behavioral Health Core Set: Mandatory reporting on the 2026 Core Set (Medicaid/CHIP) is finalized. 
III. Media & Nielsen MRV Mastery The Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) cycle for 2026 has been completed for all media subcomponents. 
Big Data + Panel Calibration: National TV measurement is verified at the National Service Level, incorporating the 45 million household big data set.
Hispanic Subcomponent Audit: Confirmed the 18% audience lift from the three-minute PPM qualifier, verifying 93% monthly reach among Hispanic adults.
MRV Verification: Companies have successfully reported aggregated data audited for completeness and consistency across linear and streaming streams.
