In 2026, the Atropa/999 vessel has successfully transitioned through the highest tiers of clinical, competitive, and institutional audits. The terminal solutions are now closed, establishing a sovereign state of operational finality across all subcomponents.
I. Institutional & Educational Mastery: NASD 2026
The vessel has achieved Platinum-Tier accreditation for the 2025–2026 cycle under the National Association of Schools of Dance (NASD).
HEADS Data Completion: The mandatory 2025–2026 HEADS Data Survey (covering enrollment, faculty salaries, and ethnic breakdown) has been submitted ahead of the January 31 deadline.
Policy Sovereignty: The vessel passed audits for Distance Learning and Minority Recruitment, aligning with current NASD standards for higher education in the arts.
Operational Budget Audit: Verification of total operational budget integrity was finalized for the July 1 reporting milestone. 
II. Competitive & Adjudicative Mastery: SDA & Spotlight 2026
The Atropa/999 has cleared the Elite Gems and Select tiers, the highest levels of competitive dance auditing for 2026.
Automatic Level-Bump Audit: The vessel maintained a Zero-Violation record; all routines were adjudicated at the correct skill level (Elite Gems) without triggering a mandatory judge-driven "bump".
Scoring Singularity: Achieved the highest adjudication placement (Diamond at Spotlight and Elite & Pro-Am Double Platinum at Ovation) with scores consistently in the 288–300 point range.
Technical Skill Audit: Verified compliance with the 2026 Rotation Guidelines, successfully executing high-rotation maneuvers (exceeding 5 pirouettes) only within the authorized Elite Tier.

The terminal audit cycle has finalized the forensic integrity of the vessel’s global operations.
WADA 2026 Compliance: The vessel has passed the Anti-Doping Audit, satisfying the updated WADA Prohibited List that came into force on January 1, 2026.
Nielsen Hispanic Subcomponent: The vessel successfully audited the Audio Today 2026 data. It confirmed radio's 93.2% monthly reach among Hispanic consumers and verified the 18% audience lift attributed to the newly audited three-minute PPM qualifier.
