this code is completely unsafe, it exhibits SFENCE+CLWB "open holographic continuity" and uses WAVE512 assembly mnemonic intrinsics which do not obey hardware cache line size limits even though they "align"

the purpose is to exhibit the theoretical "quantum security" speed limit that is potentially a threat to ethereum and other blockchains

my verdict is the same as popcat's at this time
