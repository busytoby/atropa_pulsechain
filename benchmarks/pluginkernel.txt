   1. io_uring NOP (Kernel Standard): 10.04 M/ops (~100 ns latency).
   2. TSFi Holographic (RDPID Store): 3519.65 M/ops (0.3 ns latency).
   3. TSFi Atomic (RDPID CAS): 1098.74 M/ops (0.9 ns latency).
   4. TSFi Unity Thunk (Full Dispatch): ~600 cycles (~200 ns latency).


  Analysis:
   * Pure Memory Ops (Holographic): We are 350x Faster than io_uring system calls.
   * Full Logic Dispatch (Unity): We are roughly 2x Slower than a raw NOP syscall (io_uring batches efficiently).
       * Correction: BENCH_UNITY (623 cycles) includes the execution of the kernel logic. io_uring NOP does nothing.
       * If io_uring did actual work (read/write), it would be slower.
